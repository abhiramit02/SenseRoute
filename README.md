A Smart AI-Powered Virtual Assistant for Visually Impaired
Project Name: SenseRoute â€“ AI-Powered Assistive Personal Assistant

Description:
SenseRoute is a voice-activated smart assistant built to assist the visually impaired by providing real-time environment awareness and interaction. It integrates computer vision, OCR, speech processing, and smart alerts to help users navigate and interact with their surroundings more safely and effectively.

Key Features:
- Object Detection using YOLOv8
- OCR for reading text from images using Tesseract
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) for spoken feedback
- Gmail API integration to alert guardians in emergency cases
- Voice commands to:
  - Describe the environment
  - Fetch local news
  - Play a maze game
  - Read text aloud
- Environment change detection and alerting

Technologies Used:
- Python
- YOLOv8, OpenCV
- Tesseract OCR
- pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech)
- SpeechRecognition
- Gmail API
- React.js (frontend)
- Node.js, Express.js (backend)

How It Works (Brief):
1. The assistant listens for voice commands.
2. Based on the command, it activates object detection, OCR, or information retrieval.
3. Descriptions are read out using TTS.
4. In case of abnormal changes or emergency detection, an alert is sent to a registered guardian email.

Status:
Currently under development. Major modules implemented. Final integration in progress.

Planned Enhancements:
- Add audio feedback customization
- Improve UI with voice interaction in frontend
- Deploy as a standalone app (desktop/mobile)
